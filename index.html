        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Hello again! My name is Zakaryas Henderson, a graduate from the University of Oklahoma with a B.B.A in Management Information Systems. My academic journey has equipped me with a solid foundation in Technology, but there's more to me than just my degree.
        <p>
            During my time in college, I had the opportunity to serve my country in the Oklahoma Army National Guard, where I learned the importance of leadership and teamwork. This experience not only deepened my passion for learning, but also enhanced my problem-solving and collaboration abilities.
            I'm a firm believer in continuous learning and enjoy staying updated on the latest advancements in Technology.
            When I'm not immersed in the world of technology, you can find me Exercising, Disc Golfing, and exploring the world. I believe in the power of a well-rounded individual, and these activities contribute to my creativity and ability to approach challenges from different perspectives.</>
            As I step into the professional arena, I bring a unique blend of academic knowledge, practical experience, and a genuine passion for technology. Let's connect and explore how my skills and enthusiasm can contribute to your team!
